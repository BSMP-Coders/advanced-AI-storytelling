## ‚úÖ **Step 1: Brainstorming an ‚ÄúAI for Good‚Äù Idea**

**Objective**: Generate a creative idea that solves a real-world problem using AI.

### üß† **Initial Prompt (typed into Copilot):**

> ```
> Give me an idea for an AI for Good tool that helps animals in shelters.
> ```

<details>
<summary>üì¨ **See what Copilot suggested**</summary>

- ‚ÄúAI camera that tracks dog behavior and sends alerts to shelter staff.‚Äù
- ‚ÄúAn app that predicts when a dog is stressed or anxious.‚Äù
- ‚ÄúAI-generated music to calm barking dogs.‚Äù

</details>

<details>
<summary>üìù **My Thought Process (click to expand)**</summary>

- I liked the third idea‚Äî**music for anxious dogs**‚Äîbecause it felt emotional and visual.
- I imagined dogs barking, and the AI sensing noise and calming them in real-time.
- I made the idea more specific by adding **location** (kennels), **input** (dog emotion from sound/movement), and **output** (custom music).

</details>


### ‚úÖ **Finalized ‚ÄúAI for Good‚Äù Idea:**

> ```
> A custom AI music app placed in kennels to calm dogs when they‚Äôre upset.
> ```

## ‚úÖ **Step 2: Writing the Storyboard Prompt**

**Objective**: Clearly structure your idea into a detailed storyboard prompt.

### üìã **Storyboard Prompt Template:**

```
Title: [Name + emoji]
Concept: [What‚Äôs the AI for Good idea in 1‚Äì2 sentences?]

Beginning:
Where is the story set? What‚Äôs the problem?

Middle:
How does the AI help? What happens?

End:
What‚Äôs the outcome? Who benefits?

Message:
What does this story say about AI helping the world?
```

### üß† **Initial Prompt I Gave Copilot:**

> ```
> Write a short storyboard (using the storyboard template below) about an AI speaker that calms dogs in a shelter by playing relaxing music when they are upset.
>

> Storyboard Template

> Title: [Name + emoji]
> Concept: [What‚Äôs the AI for Good idea in 1‚Äì2 sentences?]
> 
> Beginning:

> Middle:
> How does the AI help? What happens?
> 
> End:
> What‚Äôs the outcome? Who benefits?
> 
> Message:
> What does this story say about AI helping the world?
> ```
> 

<details>
<summary>üì¨ **Copilot's Initial Response (click to expand)**</summary>

- **Beginning:** A loud animal shelter filled with barking.
- **Middle:** A new AI speaker is tested. Music begins playing. Dogs become calmer.
- **End:** One dog stops barking and lies down.
- **Message:** AI can improve animal welfare.

</details>

<details>
<summary>üìù **My Feedback & Edits (click to expand)**</summary>

- Too short and vague.
- Needed **scene detail** (What time of day? What do we see/hear?)
- Needed **emotion** (Which dog? What‚Äôs the outcome?)
- Needed an **emotional arc** and **clear message**.

</details>


### ‚úÖ **Final Storyboard Prompt (Ready for Copilot Create or Clipchamp):**

```
Title: üê∂ Chill Vibes for Shelter Dogs  
Concept: An AI music generator that detects a dog‚Äôs emotional state through sounds and movement, then plays music that helps calm them.  

Beginning: A busy animal shelter in the evening. Dogs bark anxiously in their kennels. A shelter worker installs a small AI-powered speaker that lights up as it detects noise.  

Middle: The speaker begins to play soft, responsive music that adjusts based on the dogs‚Äô moods. Barking slows. One nervous puppy sits quietly, ears perked. Another curls up and dozes.  

End: A family adopts one of the dogs. At home, they record a loving voice message. The AI turns it into a calming melody. The dog listens, tail wagging, finally at peace.  

Message: AI can bring comfort and connection‚Äîeven to those without a voice.
