### üìç Introduction  
Welcome to Lesson 8! In this session, we explore how to use Azure AI Foundry and OpenAI‚Äôs Sora model to create compelling AI-generated video stories. This lesson builds on the storytelling foundations from Lesson 7 and introduces advanced prompt engineering for video generation.

### What Is OpenAI's Sora? How It Works, Examples, Features

* What is it?: OpenAI Sora is a cool AI tool that creates videos from text or images, like turning "a sunflower opening" into a short video!
* How it helps: It‚Äôs used for making creative videos, animations, or even learning tools without needing fancy equipment.
* Fun Fact: It‚Äôs like a magic wand for video creation, powered by smart technology from OpenAI.

#### Use reference images to generate videos
You can bring images to life by using the image-to-video capability that Veo has and use your existing assets or Imagen to generate something new.

### üß™ In-Class Activity  
**Objective:** Create a short AI-generated video using Sora based on a structured storyboard prompt.

**Steps:**  
1. Brainstorm an ‚ÄúAI for Good‚Äù idea  
2. Write a storyboard prompt using the template  
3. Use Sora to generate a video from your prompt  
4. (Optional) Edit in Clipchamp  
5. Share your story with the class  

**Prompt Template:**  
```
Title: [Name + emoji]  
Concept: [1‚Äì2 sentence idea]  
Beginning: [Setting + problem]  
Middle: [How AI helps]  
End: [Outcome + who benefits]  
Message: [What does this say about AI?]  
```
