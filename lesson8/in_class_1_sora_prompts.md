## Writing Effective Prompts

* Good prompts are clear and descriptive.
* Identify your core idea before refining it.
* Include subject, context, and action in prompts.
* Specify the style for desired visual effects.
* Optional elements: camera motion and composition.
* Consider ambiance to enhance the scene.



### Basics for writing prompts

Good prompts are descriptive and clear. To get your generated video closer to what you want, start with identifying your core idea and then refine your idea by adding keywords and modifiers.
The following elements should be included in your prompt:
* Subject: The object, person, animal, or scenery that you want in your video.
* Context: The background or context in which the subject is placed.
* Action: What the subject is doing (for example, walking, running, or turning their head).
* Style: This can be general or very specific. Consider using specific film style keywords, such as horror film, film noir, or animated styles like cartoon style render.
* Camera motion: Optional: What the camera is doing, such as aerial view, eye-level, top-down shot, or low-angle shot.
* Composition: Optional: How the shot is framed, such as wide shot, close-up, or extreme close-up.
* Ambiance: Optional: How the color and light contribute to the scene, such as blue tones, night, or warm tones.
