Title: üê∂ Chill Vibes for Shelter Dogs
Concept: An AI music generator that detects a dog‚Äôs emotional state through sounds and movement, then plays music that helps calm them.
Storyboard Prompt:
Beginning: A busy animal shelter in the evening. Dogs bark anxiously in their kennels. A shelter worker installs a small AI-powered speaker that lights up as it detects noise.
Middle: The speaker begins to play soft, responsive music that adjusts based on the dogs‚Äô moods. Barking slows. One nervous puppy sits quietly, ears perked. Another curls up and dozes.
End: A family adopts one of the dogs. At home, they record a loving voice message. The AI turns it into a calming melody. The dog listens, tail wagging, finally at peace.
Message: AI can bring comfort and connection‚Äîeven to those without a voice.
