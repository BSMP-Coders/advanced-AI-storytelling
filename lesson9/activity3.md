# 🎯 Activity 3: Ethics Roleplay — "What Would You Do?" <!-- {docsify-ignore-all} -->

## Overview

In this discussion-based activity, students will take on different real-world roles and respond to an ethical AI scenario. The goal is to understand how different people are affected by AI decisions and how we might hold AI systems accountable.

## 🧠 Objectives

* Practice ethical reasoning and empathy
* Understand how AI decisions can impact people differently
* Discuss how to make AI more fair and transparent

---

## 🕒 Time: 10–12 minutes

## 📍 Format: Group discussion (in chat or breakout groups)

## 👥 Setup

Have students pick or assign a role:

* 🧑‍🏫 Teacher
* 👨‍⚖️ Judge
* 👩 Student
* 📰 Journalist

## 🧩 Scenario:

"An AI was used to decide who would get a \$10,000 scholarship. It used past grades and zip code, but it turns out it skipped over students from low-income neighborhoods."

**Prompt**: As your role, what would you say or do?

* Should the results be canceled?
* Who is responsible?
* Should AI be allowed to make decisions like this?

---

## 💬 Instructions

1. Give students 1–2 minutes to consider their response in character.
2. Have them type or say their answers — you can do this:

   * In chat (fast responses)
   * In small groups (if breakout rooms are available)
